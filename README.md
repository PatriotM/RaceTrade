---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows OS (7/8/10/11)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- CBFTP server configured and running
- ZNC/IRC bouncer (recommended)

### Initial Setup (First Time Only)

#### Step 1: Add Your CBFTP Server
1. Click **"CBFTP Server"** button in main window
2. Fill in:
   - **Host:** Your CBFTP server IP/hostname
   - **Port:** Usually 55477
   - **Password:** Your CBFTP API password
   - **Profile:** e.g., "RACE"
3. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 2: Import Sites from CBFTP
1. Click **"Sync From CBFTP"**
2. Select your CBFTP server from the dropdown
3. Click **"Fetch Sites"**
4. Tick the sites you want to import
5. Click **"Import Selected Sites"**
6. Sites are now created with names and categories
   > ℹ️ Only categories and sitename are imported; you still configure IRC yourself

### Basic Configuration (After Import)

Now configure a site for racing:

1. **Select a site** from the site dropdown (top of main window)
2. Click **"Edit Site"** (or double-click the site)
3. In the Site Editor:
   - Make sure the IRC section you want to race is present in the top-left **"IRC Sections"** list
   - In the bottom-left **"Race Sections (irc)"** list, make sure that section is **Enabled** using the Enable/Disable buttons
   - In the top-left **"IRC Sections"** list, select that section (e.g., "TV-1080P")
   - In the top-middle **"Cbftp Sections"** list, select the matching CBFTP section (e.g., "TV-1080P" or "MOVIES-HD")
   - Click **"Map"**
   - In **"Mapping trigger (regex)"** enter: `.*/i` (match everything)
   - Leave Section Rules and Tag Rules empty for now
   - Click **"Save"** in the site editor

4. **Start the trader**. You should see:
   - `[DETECTED]` in the Race log when an announce hits
   - `[RACING]` when the spreadjob is started
   - `[COMPLETED]`/`[FAILED]`/`[TIMEOUT]` when CBFTP finishes

### Alternative: Manual Site Setup (Without CBFTP Import)

1. Click **"Add Site"**
2. In the Site Editor:
   - **General:**
     - Sitename: must match CBFTP sitename if you want auto section import
     - Announce: choose announce bot/mode from dropdown
   - **ZNC/IRC:**
     - Host, Port
     - Username / network
     - Password (stored encrypted)
   - **Channels:**
     - Add announce channels in "Channels" list
     - Add Blowfish keys where needed
3. In **"Race Sections and Mapping":**
   - Add IRC sections (these usually match the site's paths, e.g., TV-DE, MP3)
   - In bottom-left "Race Sections (irc)", Enable those sections
   - Map each IRC section to one or more CBFTP sections
   - Set "Mapping trigger (regex)" for each mapping (tag)
4. Click **"Save"**

### TL;DR

```
Add CBFTP server → Sync sites → Edit each site → Enable IRC sections 
in "Race Sections (irc)" → Map IRC → CBFTP → Done
```

### Quick Explanation

- **IRC Section** = What the site announces in IRC (e.g., `[TV-DE]`, `[X264-HD]`)
- **CBFTP Section** = Logical section name in CBFTP (e.g., TV-DE, MOVIES-HD)
- **Mapping (Tag)** = IRC section + CBFTP section + trigger regex (+ tag rules)
- **Section Rules** = Filters that apply to **all** mappings for that IRC section
- **Tag Rules** = Filters for **one** mapping only (per CBFTP section)

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### How It Works - The Flow

#### Step 1: IRC ANNOUNCE RECEIVED
```
Example: "[TV-DE] Show.Name.S01E01.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP"
```

#### Step 2: EXTRACT SECTION NAME
```
Section: "TV-DE" (from the announce line)
```

#### Step 3: CHECK IF SECTION IS ENABLED
```
Is "TV-DE" Enabled in "Race Sections (irc)" for this site?
  - If NO → ignore
  - If YES → continue
```

#### Step 4: FIND MATCHING MAPPING
```
In "Race Sections and Mapping", find a mapping where:
  - IRC Section is "TV-DE"
  - The mapping's "Mapping trigger (regex)" matches the release name

The FIRST mapping whose trigger matches will be used
```

#### Step 5: EVALUATE RULES
```
1. Section rules for the IRC section (TV-DE):
   - All DROP rules evaluated first
   - Then Section ALLOW rules

2. Tag rules for this mapping (IRC=TV-DE → CBFTP=TV-DE or MOVIES-HD etc):
   - If a Tag rule matches, its ACTION (ALLOW/DROP) is used

3. If nothing matches: default action is ALLOW
```

#### Step 6: SEND TO CBFTP (SPREADJOB)
```
Racetrade sends:
  section  = CBFTP section name
  name     = release name
  sites    = list of allowed sites
  profile  = CBFTP profile (e.g., RACE)

CBFTP log:
  [JOB SENT]
  [JOB STARTED] Job#1234: Release → CBFTP-Server

Race log:
  [RACING] line:
  [2025-.. ..:..:..] :: [TV-DE] :: [SiteAlpha,SiteBeta] :: [RACING] :: Release.Name...
```

#### Step 7: MONITOR CBFTP JOB
```
Racetrade periodically polls CBFTP `spreadjobs/{release}`
Reads:
  status (DONE / FAILED / TIMEOUT / ACTIVE / etc)
  sites, sites_incomplete
  size_estimated_bytes
  time_spent_seconds

When terminal:
  DONE     → [COMPLETED]
  FAILED   → [FAILED]
  TIMEOUT  → [FAILED] with timeout reason

Race log examples:
  [COMPLETED] :: [TV-DE] :: [SiteAlpha,SiteBeta] :: Release
  [FAILED]    :: [TV-DE] :: [SiteAlpha,SiteBeta] :: Release (CBFTP transfer failed)
```

### Log Windows

| Log Window | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Race Log** | High-level race info per release: `[DETECTED]`, `[RACING]`, `[COMPLETED]`, `[FAILED]` |
| **CBFTP Log** | Detailed job messages and Job# progress |
| **Application Log** | App-level info, errors, rules engine messages |
| **IRC Log** | Raw IRC events: connect, join, announces, FiSH status, errors |

### IRC Sections vs CBFTP Sections

#### IRC Sections
- Names emitted by the site in IRC
- Often equal to the path name on that site
- **Example on SiteAlpha:** X264-HD-1080P, TV-DE, MP3
- **Example on SiteBeta:** X264-HD, TV, MUSiC

#### CBFTP Sections
- Logical names defined in CBFTP's section config
- All sites racing together share these names
- CBFTP handles per-site paths internally for that section
- **Example:** MOVIES-HD exists for SiteAlpha and SiteBeta with different paths

#### Mapping
For each site, you map its IRC sections to shared CBFTP sections:
```
SiteAlpha: IRC X264-HD-1080P → CBFTP MOVIES-HD
SiteBeta:  IRC X264-HD       → CBFTP MOVIES-HD
```

Trigger regex & rules decide which releases go into which mapping.

- They apply only to this single combination of IRC section + CBFTP section
- Use them for mapping-specific filters (e.g., MOVIES-HD on one site)
- Label reminder: "DROP run before ALLOW rules" – within this list, DROP rules are evaluated before ALLOW rules

**Bottom-right box: "Section Rules: DROP takes priority over ALLOW"**  
(listBox6)
- These rules apply to **all mappings** in the selected IRC section
- Perfect for global blocks:
  ```
  [release] contains INTERNAL DROP
  [group]   isin BadGroup1,BadGroup2 DROP
  ```
- First, all Section DROP rules run; then Section ALLOW rules

#### BOTTOM LEFT GROUPS

**New Regex:**

---

## 📜 Rules System

### Rule Format

```
[key] operator value ACTION
```

- **[key]:** Field to check (release, section, group, year, etc.)
- **operator:** Comparison type
- **value:** Right-hand side of comparison
- **ACTION:** ALLOW or DROP (EXCEPT reserved / advanced)

**Examples:**
```
[release] contains INTERNAL DROP
[group]   isin BadGroup1,BadGroup2 DROP
[release] contains 1080p ALLOW
```

---

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Exact match (case-insensitive) | `[section] == TV-DE` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `[quality] != 720p` |
| `iswm` | Wildcard match (* and ?) | `[release] iswm *1080p*` |
| `matches` | Regex pattern match | `[release] matches (?i)\bGERMAN\b` |
| `contains` | Substring exists | `[release] contains INTERNAL` |
| `startswith` | Begins with substring | `[release] startswith Movie` |
| `endswith` | Ends with substring | `[release] endswith 2024` |
| `isin` | Left side is contained in comma/pipe-separated list | `[group] isin GROUP1,GROUP2` |

---

### Available Keys

| Key | Description | Example Value |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| `[release]` | Full release name | `Movie.2024.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP` |
| `[section]` | IRC section name | `TV-DE`, `X264-HD` |
| `[group]` | Release group name | `GROUP` |
| `[year]` | Movie/show year (if extracted) | `2024` |
| `[quality]` | Quality tag (if extracted) | `1080p`, `2160p` |
| `[source]` | Source tag (if extracted) | `WEB`, `BluRay` |

---

### Wildcard Patterns (ISWM)

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | Any characters |
| `?` | Single character |

**Examples:**
```
*1080p*           - contains "1080p"
*WEB*             - contains "WEB"
*.GERMAN.*        - ".GERMAN." somewhere
*S??E??*          - S01E01, S10E23, etc.
```

---

### Regex Patterns (MATCHES)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `.` | Any character |
| `.*` | Anything |
| `.+` | One or more |
| `[0-9]` | Any digit |
| `(a\|b)` | a OR b |
| `^` | Start of string |
| `$` | End of string |
| `\b` | Word boundary |
| `\.` | Literal dot |

**Examples:**
```
(?i).*1080p.*           - contains 1080p (case-insensitive)
.*S[0-9]{2}E[0-9]{2}.*  - season/episode S01E01
^Movie.*2024$           - starts with Movie and ends with 2024
```

---

### Precise Language Matches Using \b

To drop a language without dropping similar words, use regex with `\b`:

```
[release] matches (?i)\bGERMAN\b DROP
[release] matches (?i)\bFRENCH\b DROP
[release] matches (?i)\biTALiAN\b DROP
[release] matches (?i)\bPOLISH\b DROP
```

**Examples:**
```
The.Carman.Family.Deaths.2025.POLISH.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP
  → Dropped by POLISH rule

The.Hand.That.Rocks.the.Cradle.2025.FRENCH.720p.WEB.H264-GROUP
  → Dropped by FRENCH rule
```

**Alternative (less precise):**
```
[release] iswm *.GERMAN.* DROP
```

---

### Rule Priority

> ⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT** - The rules engine evaluates in this order:

```
1) Section DROP rules (for this IRC section)
   └─ If any matches → release is DROPPED immediately

2) Tag rules (for the selected mapping)
   └─ Checked only if the mapping's trigger matched
   └─ If a Tag rule matches, its ACTION (ALLOW/DROP) wins for that mapping

3) Section ALLOW rules (for this IRC section)
   └─ Checked only if no Section DROP and no Tag rule matched

4) Default
   └─ If no rules match anywhere → ALLOW
```

**Practically:**
- Section rules are global for that IRC section
- Tag rules let you fine-tune per CBFTP mapping
- DROP always wins when it matches

---

## 🏷️ Tag Rules vs Section Rules

### Section Rules (per IRC section)

**Location:** Bottom-right "Section Rules" box

**Scope:** Apply to **ALL** mappings under that IRC section

**Evaluation:** First: all DROP rules, then ALLOW rules

**Great for global blocks:**
```
[release] contains INTERNAL DROP
[group]   isin BadGroup1,BadGroup2 DROP
[release] matches (?i)\bPOLISH\b DROP
```

---

### Tag Rules (per mapping / per CBFTP section)

**Location:** Top-right bottom box: "CBFTP Mapping Rules: DROP run before ALLOW rules"

**Scope:** Apply **ONLY** to the selected mapping in "Mapped Section"

**Evaluation:** After Section DROP rules

**Good for:**
- Quality filters per mapping
- Group whitelists per mapping
- Special rules for MOVIES-HD vs MOVIES-LQ etc.

---

### Hierarchy Example

```
Site
└── IRC Section: MOVIES-HD
    ├── Section Rules (affect all mappings in MOVIES-HD)
    ├── Mapping A: MOVIES-HD → X264-HD-1080P
    │   └── Tag Rules for X264-HD-1080P only
    └── Mapping B: MOVIES-HD → X264-HD-720P
        └── Tag Rules for X264-HD-720P only
```

**Remember:**
- **Section Rules** = wide net (per IRC section)
- **Tag Rules** = narrow net (per mapping)

---

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example: Shared CBFTP Section with Different Per-Site Filters

**Goal:**
- Use one shared CBFTP section: **MOVIES-HD**
- **SiteAlpha** must be strict: only 1080p
- **SiteBeta** can send both 720p and 1080p

**CBFTP:**
```
Section: MOVIES-HD
  - CBFTP is configured so MOVIES-HD exists for both SiteAlpha and SiteBeta
    with their own paths
```

---

#### SiteAlpha Configuration

**IRC Sections:**
```
X264-HD-1080P    (path on SiteAlpha is also X264-HD-1080P)
```

**Race Sections (irc):**
```
X264-HD-1080P is Enabled
```

**Mapping:**
```
- Select IRC Section: X264-HD-1080P
- Select CBFTP Section: MOVIES-HD
- Click "Map" → shows in "Mapped Section"
- Mapping trigger (regex): .*/i
```

**Section Rules (for IRC section X264-HD-1080P):**
```
[release] contains 720p DROP
[release] contains CAM DROP
[release] contains HDCAM DROP
```

**Tag Rules (for MOVIES-HD mapping on SiteAlpha):**
```
(optional; you can leave empty, the Section Rules already block 720p)
```

**Result (SiteAlpha):**
```
Movie.Name.2025.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP  → ALLOWED → MOVIES-HD
Movie.Name.2025.720p.WEB.H264-GROUP   → DROPPED (contains 720p)
```

---

#### SiteBeta Configuration

**IRC Sections:**
```
X264-HD      (path on SiteBeta is X264-HD)
```

**Race Sections (irc):**
```
X264-HD is Enabled
```

**Mapping:**
```
- Select IRC Section: X264-HD
- Select CBFTP Section: MOVIES-HD
- Click "Map"
- Mapping trigger (regex): .*/i
```

**Section Rules (for IRC section X264-HD):**
```
[release] contains CAM DROP
[release] contains HDCAM DROP
```

**Tag Rules (for MOVIES-HD mapping on SiteBeta):**
```
(none - SiteBeta allows both 720p and 1080p)
```

**Result (SiteBeta):**
```
Movie.Name.2025.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP  → ALLOWED → MOVIES-HD
Movie.Name.2025.720p.WEB.H264-GROUP   → ALLOWED → MOVIES-HD
```

---

### Summary

- Both sites race into the same CBFTP section **MOVIES-HD**
- On **SiteAlpha**, the IRC section X264-HD-1080P has Section Rules that drop 720p
- On **SiteBeta**, the IRC section X264-HD does not drop 720p
- CBFTP paths are per site inside the MOVIES-HD section
- RaceTrade only cares about which CBFTP section name to use per site

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Nothing is being raced

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Is the IRC section present in "IRC Sections"?
- ✅ Is that section **Enabled** in "Race Sections (irc)"?
- ✅ Is there at least one mapping in "Mapped Section" for that IRC section?
- ✅ Does the mapping's trigger regex match? (try `.*/i`)
- ✅ Are Section DROP rules blocking everything?
- ✅ Did you click all the "Save" buttons (trigger save + site save)?

**Fix:**
- Temporarily remove all rules
- Use `.*/i` as trigger
- Enable Debug Mode and watch Application + Race logs

---

### Problem: Releases going to wrong CBFTP section

- Check the order of mappings (first trigger that matches wins)
- Make specific triggers first, catch-all mapping with `.*/i` last
- Check logs for which mapping was selected

---

### Problem: All releases are dropped

- Look at Section Rules box:
  ```
  [release] matches .* DROP
  ```
  will drop everything for that IRC section
- Remove or narrow overly broad DROP rules
- Use debug mode: it will show:
  ```
  [DROP] Global DROP rule matched: ...
  ```

---

### Problem: Hard to see what matched

- Enable Debug Mode
- Application log will show:
  ```
  [✓] Rule matched: [release] contains INTERNAL, Input='...'
  ```
- Race log shows when a release is filtered (FILTERED / DROPPED) vs raced

---

## 🎓 Advanced Configurations

### Multiple Sites Into Same CBFTP Section
- Configure that CBFTP section for all sites inside CBFTP
- In each site's editor:
  ```
  IRC Section: TV-DE or X264-FOREIGN
  CBFTP Section: TV-DE
  ```
- Use Section Rules per site to express per-site preferences

### Using PreBot vs Direct Site Announces
- PreBot configuration allows racing based on pre announcements
- Configure in site settings under "Announce" dropdown
- Select appropriate PreBot from dropdown

### Group Whitelisting via Tag Rules
```
Tag Rule for specific mapping:
[group] isin APPROVED1,APPROVED2,APPROVED3 ALLOW
[group] != * DROP    (drop everything else)
```

### Language-Based Filtering
```
Use regex word boundaries for precision:
[release] matches (?i)\bGERMAN\b DROP
[release] matches (?i)\bFRENCH\b DROP
```

### Quality-Based Routing
Split 720p / 1080p / 2160p into different CBFTP sections:
```
Mapping 1: IRC Section → MOVIES-HD-1080P
  Trigger: .*1080p.*
  
Mapping 2: IRC Section → MOVIES-HD-720P
  Trigger: .*720p.*
  
Mapping 3: IRC Section → MOVIES-UHD
  Trigger: .*2160p.*
```

### Performance Tips
- ⚡ Put global DROP rules in Section Rules
- ⚡ Keep triggers simple where possible
- ⚡ Place specific mappings (1080p, 2160p) before catch-all mappings
- ⚡ Enable user tracking only when chat window is visible

## 🆘 Need Help?

Enable **Debug Mode** and check:

| Log Window | What to Check |
|------------|---------------|
| **Application log** | Rules & config messages |
| **IRC log** | Announces and connection status |
| **CBFTP log** | Spreadjob status |
| **Race log** | `[DETECTED]`, `[RACING]`, `[COMPLETED]`, `[FAILED]` |

### Common Issues

In almost all cases, the problem is:
- ❌ Section not Enabled in "Race Sections (irc)"
- ❌ Missing mapping (you forgot to click "Map")
- ❌ Trigger regex not matching (too strict)
- ❌ Section DROP rule too broad
- ❌ Confusing Section Rules vs Tag Rules
- ❌ Forgot to click "Save"
